# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Traditional product research methods like focus groups and surveys have significant limitations:

1. **High Costs**: Recruiting participants, facilitating sessions, and analyzing results is expensive
2. **Limited Scale**: Traditional methods can only process a small subset of customer opinions
3. **Bias Concerns**: In-person dynamics can lead to groupthink or dominant voices influencing outcomes
4. **Time Constraints**: Traditional research takes weeks or months to organize and complete

This project addresses these challenges by creating an AI-powered system that can continuously analyze customer reviews, generate realistic customer personas, and simulate focus group discussions to surface actionable insights.

## User Journey

### For Product Researchers & Marketers
1. **Input**: Provide URLs to e-commerce sites with product reviews
2. **Processing**: The system scrapes reviews, generates personas, and runs simulated discussions automatically
3. **Output**: Receive detailed summaries and product improvement recommendations

The system enables product teams to:
- Rapidly iterate on product ideas based on customer feedback
- Understand customer needs across different segments
- Identify specific improvement opportunities
- Test different product concepts through simulated conversations
- Scale research efforts without proportional increases in cost

## Business Value

1. **Reduced Research Costs**: Eliminate expenses for recruiting, venue, moderation, and transcription
2. **Accelerated Insights**: Generate findings in hours vs. weeks/months
3. **Broader Feedback Base**: Analyze hundreds/thousands of reviews vs. 8-12 focus group participants
4. **Continuous Research**: Run new simulations as more reviews become available
5. **Scalable Approach**: Apply the same methodology across different product categories

## Target Users
