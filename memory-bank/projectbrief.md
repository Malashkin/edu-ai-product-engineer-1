# Project Brief: AI-powered Product Research Pipeline

## Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end AI pipeline for product research and improvement, designed to work with a variety of product categories, including cosmetics, mobile applications, consumer electronics, and more. The system scrapes customer reviews from multiple e-commerce sites or app stores, generates user personas based on review analysis, conducts simulated group discussions between these personas, and produces actionable product improvement recommendations.

## Core Requirements

1. **Data Collection**

   - Scrape product reviews from multiple e-commerce sites or app stores
   - Store raw and processed review data
   - Handle different website structures and formats

2. **User Persona Generation**

   - Generate detailed customer personas from review data
   - Identify key demographics, needs, pain points, and preferences
   - Create realistic behavioral profiles for discussion simulation

3. **Group Discussion Simulation**

   - Simulate realistic focus group discussions between AI personas
   - Facilitate multi-turn conversation flow among participants
   - Capture diverse perspectives and identify consensus points

4. **Insight Generation**

   - Summarize key discussion points and findings
   - Generate specific product improvement recommendations
   - Provide actionable insights for product development teams

## Technical Objectives

1. Create a modular, extensible pipeline architecture
2. Implement robust error handling and logging
3. Use OpenAI's API efficiently for various text generation tasks
4. Ensure the system can be adapted to different product categories
5. Create detailed output documentation for product teams

## Success Metrics

1. Successfully scrape and process reviews from multiple sources
2. Generate diverse, realistic personas with distinct characteristics
3. Produce coherent, insightful group discussions
4. Generate actionable product improvement recommendations
5. Complete the pipeline end-to-end without manual intervention

## Current Development Status

The project is functional with a focus on mascara products, with active development to improve robustness, handle different product types, and optimize token usage for the OpenAI API calls.
