## Current Focus Areas

### 1. Error Handling & Robustness

Recent work has focused on improving error handling throughout the pipeline, particularly:

- Handling missing or invalid persona generation results
- Ensuring discussions can proceed even if some personas fail to generate
- Proper file path handling for output storage

### 2. Token Usage Optimization

We've implemented strategies to manage token usage more efficiently:

- Limiting the number of reviews processed (configurable, currently set to 100)
- Limiting text length for review analysis (configurable, currently set to 10,000 characters)
- Using targeted model selection based on task complexity

### 3. Directory Structure Management

Ensuring consistent file organization:

- All outputs stored in the 'output' directory
- Standardized file naming with timestamps
- Memory Bank implementation for project documentation
